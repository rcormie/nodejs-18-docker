# nodejs-18-docker
This repository provides a Docker Compose configuration for running a Node.js 18 application inside a Docker container. It allows you to easily set up a development environment for your Node.js projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your operating system.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Node.js 18 Docker Compose container:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```bash
   cd node18-docker-compose-container
   ```

3. Update the `app/app.js` file with your Node.js application code. This file contains a simple "Hello World" example, but you can modify it according to your project's requirements.

4. Start the Docker container using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image and start the container. You will see the output of the Node.js application in the console.

5. Access your Node.js application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the "Hello World" message from your Node.js application.

6. To stop the Docker container, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the container is running.

## Customization

You can customize the Docker Compose configuration according to your project's specific needs. Here are a few possible modifications:

- Update the exposed port: If you want your Node.js application to run on a different port, modify the `ports` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Install additional dependencies: If your application requires additional dependencies, you can install them by adding the necessary commands to the `command` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Mount additional volumes: If you have other directories or files that need to be accessible inside the container, you can add additional volumes to the `volumes` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
